# Codeathon-Fall-2021-Lower division problemset repo



## Deadlines:

### October 10th - Completed Backstory / Problem Setup

    The backstory will just be the context for your problem and will try to hide any reference to the
    algorithm so that its not super easy to look up. The problem setup is everything else that tells the
    programmer what they need to do. On the outside, it should look as though you have completed the entire
    problem and that it is ready to be solved. In reality you do not need to have the solution or test case
    generation completed yet. (See TheMonkGame and SameStart for an idea of what this looks like)
    
### October 15th - Solution and Input/Output Generation

    By this date you need to have created a solution to your problem as well as a test case generator.
    The solution should take in the information from your problem and then spit out the right anwsers. 
    Use the solution to help create and label the test cases with the right anwsers. In theory after
    this date your problem should be entirely completed. The last week will basically be polishing the
    problems as well as testing them on Hackerrank to make sure everything works. Furthermore, it would
    be nice if we could attempt to solve each other's problems to make sure everything makes sense and that
    its not too hard.
    
### October 22nd 7:00pm - Codeathon

    Obviously by this date your problem needs to be completely done; ready to solve without
    any hiccups or roadblocks. Hopefully everything will be done well before this date though!
