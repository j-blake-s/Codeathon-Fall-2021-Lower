Stan has caught them all. And now that he has them all, he wants to make some big bucks. 
Stan needs to find a way to approximate the maximize the value of each card in his collection. 
To do that, he has poured over historical data, looking at the sale and purchase prices of millions 
of cards over time. Given that each data point represents either a sale or a purchase over a timeframe, 
help Stan compute the maximum value possible through performing one purchase and one sale at a given time. 
  
At a given timestamp only one operation can occur, purchase or sale. The total number of purchase and sell 
operations that can take place are unlimited. For example, the data is a list of prices, i.e. 
  
156 572 12 56 9076 789 23
	
The maximum profit is 9076-12= 9064
