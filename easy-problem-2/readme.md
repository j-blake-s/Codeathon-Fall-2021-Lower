Title: "Shift Sift"

Desc: have an array of values. You look through the values once, add the up into "sum". Then you shift the array 
left (remove index 0), run through the values and add up to "sum" again. Then you shift the array right (delete
index -1), then loop again, adding to "sum". Repeat until one element, loop on the one element, add to "sum", then pop the last element. Now the array has length 0. Enter the sum as your answer.
